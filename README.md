# This is an issue regarding expo-router.

- When entering the "signin" page, the page transition animation between the "resetpassword" page and the "signin" page during this period is very abnorma

- Personally, I replaced "slide_from_right" with "slide_from_bottom" to solve this problem. However, I actually prefer to use "slide_from_right".
